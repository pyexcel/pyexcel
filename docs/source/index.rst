Introduction
-------------

**pyexcel** provides **one** unified API for reading, manipulating, and writing data
in various Excel formats. It simplifies the process
of handling Excel files, making it an enjoyable task. Data in Excel files
can be easily converted into :ref:`arrays or dictionaries<a-list-of-data-structures>`
with minimal code, and vice versa. This library focuses **purely on data
processing and does not address features like fonts, colors, or charts**.



The idea behind pyexcel originated from a common usability problem: when Excel-driven
web applications are delivered to non-developer users (e.g., project assistants, human
resources administrators), they often are not aware of the differences
between file formats such as CSV, XLS, and XLSX. Rather than training users on these
formats, pyexcel provides web developers with a unified interface to handle most
Excel file types.


To add support for a specific Excel format in your application, simply install an
additional pyexcel pluginâ€”no code changes required. This eliminates issues with
different file formats. In the broader community, pyexcel and its associated
libraries aim to be a simple, easy-to-install alternative to Pandas, where minimal
data manipulation is needed.

Installation
-------------


You can install pyexcel via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install pyexcel


or clone it and install it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel.git
    $ cd pyexcel
    $ python setup.py install

Suppose you have the following data in a dictionary:

========= ====
Name      Age
========= ====
Adam      28
Beatrice  29
Ceri      30
Dean      26
========= ====

you can easily save it into an excel file using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")

And here's how to obtain the records:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel as p
   >>> records = p.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26
   >>> p.free_resources()


Custom data rendering:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> # pip install pyexcel-text==0.2.7.1
    >>> import pyexcel as p
    >>> ccs_insight2 = p.Sheet()
    >>> ccs_insight2.name = "Worldwide Mobile Phone Shipments (Billions), 2017-2021"
    >>> ccs_insight2.ndjson = """
    ... {"year": ["2017", "2018", "2019", "2020", "2021"]}
    ... {"smart phones": [1.53, 1.64, 1.74, 1.82, 1.90]}
    ... {"feature phones": [0.46, 0.38, 0.30, 0.23, 0.17]}
    ... """.strip()
    >>> ccs_insight2
    pyexcel sheet:
    +----------------+------+------+------+------+------+
    | year           | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
    +----------------+------+------+------+------+------+
    | smart phones   | 1.53 | 1.64 | 1.74 | 1.82 | 1.9  |
    +----------------+------+------+------+------+------+
    | feature phones | 0.46 | 0.38 | 0.3  | 0.23 | 0.17 |
    +----------------+------+------+------+------+------+


Advanced usage :fire:
----------------------

If you are dealing with big data, please consider these usages:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> def increase_everyones_age(generator):
   ...     for row in generator:
   ...         row['Age'] += 1
   ...         yield row
   >>> def duplicate_each_record(generator):
   ...     for row in generator:
   ...         yield row
   ...         yield row
   >>> records = p.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> io=p.isave_as(records=duplicate_each_record(increase_everyones_age(records)),
   ...     dest_file_type='csv', dest_lineterminator='\n')
   >>> print(io.getvalue())
   Age,Name
   29,Adam
   29,Adam
   30,Beatrice
   30,Beatrice
   31,Ceri
   31,Ceri
   27,Dean
   27,Dean
   <BLANKLINE>


Two advantages of above method:

#. Add as many wrapping functions as you want.
#. Constant memory consumption

   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")

Plugin shopping guide
------------------------

Since 2020, all pyexcel-io plugins have dropped the support for python versions
which are lower than 3.6. If you want to use any of those Python versions, please use pyexcel-io
and its plugins versions that are lower than 0.6.0.


Except csv files, xls, xlsx and ods files are a zip of a folder containing a lot of
xml files

The dedicated readers for excel files can stream read


In order to manage the list of plugins installed, you need to use pip to add or remove
a plugin. When you use virtualenv, you can have different plugins per virtual
environment. In the situation where you have multiple plugins that does the same thing
in your environment, you need to tell pyexcel which plugin to use per function call.
For example, pyexcel-ods and pyexcel-odsr, and you want to get_array to use pyexcel-odsr.
You need to append get_array(..., library='pyexcel-odsr').

Usage
------

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls pip-installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")

Suppose you want to process the following excel data :

.. pyexcel-table::

   ---pyexcel:example table---
   Name,Age
   Adam,28
   Beatrice,29
   Ceri,30
   Dean,26


Here are the example usages:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> records = pe.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26
   >>> pe.free_resources()

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")
