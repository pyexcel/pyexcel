This shows a pythonic way to use **Reader** class to go through a single
page spreadsheet row by row. The output is::

    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
    [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]

Please install pyexcel-xls

    # rows() returns row based iterator, meaning it can be iterated row by row
    for row in spreadsheet.rows():
        print(row)

    # Alternatively, you can use::
    #   for row in spreadsheet:
    #       print row
    # because by default **Reader** regards itself a row based iterator.
